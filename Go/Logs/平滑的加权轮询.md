# 平滑的加权轮询

平滑的加权轮询（smooth weighted round-robin balancing）

```
For edge case weights like { 5, 1, 1 } we now produce { a, a, b, a, c, a, a }
sequence instead of { c, b, a, a, a, a, a } produced previously.

Algorithm is as follows: on each peer selection we increase current_weight
of each eligible peer by its weight, select peer with greatest current_weight
and reduce its current_weight by total number of weight points distributed
among peers.

In case of { 5, 1, 1 } weights this gives the following sequence of
current_weight's:

     a  b  c
     5  1  1  (initial state)

     5  1  1  (a selected)
    -2  1  1

     3  2  2  (a selected)
    -4  2  2

     1  3  3  (b selected)
     1 -4  3

     6 -3  4  (a selected)
    -1 -3  4

     4 -2  5  (c selected)
     4 -2 -2

     9 -1 -1  (a selected)
     2 -1 -1

     7  0  0  (a selected)
     0  0  0
